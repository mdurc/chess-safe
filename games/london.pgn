1. d4 Nf6 2. Bf4 c5 3. c3 Qb6 4. Qb3 {White offers a queen trade, the most popular move by far. Black can respond with a very forcing line which will give Black a favorable position in the end.} (4. b3 cxd4 5. cxd4 (5. Qxd4 Qxd4 6. cxd4 Nc6 {This position is pleasant for Black. The engine agrees  ( Stockfish: -0.7 ) . Black has also disallowed White's London setup.})  Nc6 6. e3 {Every London player will play 6. e3 here. It's the most played move by far, but it's a huge blunder...} e5 7. dxe5 Bb4+ 8. Nd2 Ne4 9. Nf3 g5 10. Bxg5 Nxe5 11. Nxe5 Bxd2+ 12. Ke2 Qb5+ 13. Nc4 Qxg5) (4. Qc2 cxd4 5. cxd4 {Black cannot take the hanging pawn immediately.} Nc6 6. e3 d5 {Black has already prevented White's London setup and should be happy enough here, but here is an example line of what could happen if White plays the most popular move in this position.} 7.
